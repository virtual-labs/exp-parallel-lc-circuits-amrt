    A 4.5 µF capacitor passes a current of 34 mA when connected to a 100 Hz supply. 
    Calculate the supply voltage.
  </li>
  <li>
    A parallel LC circuit consists of a 100 µH inductor and a 0.001 F capacitor with an AC power source of 50 V and 100 Hz. 
    Calculate the total current flowing through the circuit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Construct a parallel LC circuit with a 50 µH inductor and a 1 µF capacitor using a power source of 10 V and 100 Hz. 
    Tabulate the total current flowing through the circuit with a decrease in frequency.
