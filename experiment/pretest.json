        "a": "average value",
        "b": "rms value",
        "c": "peak value",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "AC meters typically do not show the average of AC signals.",
        "b": "Correct! Most AC meters show the root mean square (rms) value of the current or voltage.",
        "c": "Peak value is not commonly measured directly by standard AC meters.",
        "d": "One of the above is correct."

      "question": "Alternating voltage",
      "answers": {
        "a": "is independent of time",
        "b": "varies directly with time",
        "c": "varies sinusoidally",
        "d": "varies inversely with time"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Alternating voltage changes over time.",
        "b": "Not entirely correct. It varies sinusoidally, not linearly.",
        "c": "Correct! AC voltage typically follows a sinusoidal waveform.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It's not an inverse relationship."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A choke has little effect in a DC circuit after initial current flow.",
        "b": "Correct! A choke is used in AC circuits to block high-frequency signals.",
        "c": "It's not primarily used in rectifier circuits as a resistor.",
        "d": "Not ideal for DC; mainly used in AC circuits."
